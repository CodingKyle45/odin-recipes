            <li>1 chicken breast, cut in half</li>
            <li>2 chicken leg quarters with skin</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Use rubber gloves to mince the chiles
                and place into a mixing bowl. Add cilantro,
                garlic, vegtable oil, vinegar, lime juice,
                salt, and black pepper. Mix piri piri sauce well.
            </li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts and legs into a reusable plastic
                bag. Pour in piri piri sauce, seal the bag, and shake
                gently to completely cover chicken. Put the bag in the
                refigerator to marinate at least 4 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Remove bag from the refigerator about 30 minutes
                before cooking to allow chicken to come to room
                temperature.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill to medium heat and lightly
                oil the grate.
            </li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the bag; discard bag and
                cilantro. Cook chicken on the preheated grill,
                rotating as necessary to cook evenly, until
                juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer
                inserted into the center should read at least
                165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 25 Minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Serve</li>
        </ol>
